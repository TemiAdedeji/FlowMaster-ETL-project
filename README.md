# FlowMasters ETL Project

This is a beginner-friendly **retail sales data engineering pipeline** built using Python and PostgreSQL. The goal is to simulate a real-world ETL process from raw retail data to structured insights.

##  Project Structure

```
flowmasters_ent/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  # Raw data files (Sales, Purchase, Product, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/               # Python scripts for ingestion and transformation
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore             # Files Git should ignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project overview
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (optional)
```
